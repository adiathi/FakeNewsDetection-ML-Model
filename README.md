I with My team Participated in UGC Upgrad Hackathon
in which we Created ML Model For Fake news detection using KNN, RF and LogisticRegression Methods.......


# This Git Repo Contain Folowing Files
  1) : (KNN, RF, LR Model) Creating without hypertunning  : This File Contain KNN, RF, LR Model without Hypertunning 
  2) : Fake News Detection: This File contain LR Model by merging Title and Author column
  3) : HYPERPARAMETER TUNING WITH RandomizedSearchCV : This File contain the logicticregression(), randomforestclassifier() With Hyperparameter Tunning.
  4) : Trained_model.pkl : This is the loaded model which we load using pickle
  5) : train.csv : This is the CSV file of DataSet
